He has published original research papers and presented at conferences such as Blackhat, Devoxx and OWASP. Founding leader of OWASP Java Project and contributor to OWASP ASVS. As CEO of Continuum heâ€™s responsible for IriusRisk threat modelling tool and BDD-Security open source testing framework, used in SecDevOps workflows.
